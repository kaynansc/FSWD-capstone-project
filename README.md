# Find a Community

## üìå Project Overview

**Find a Community** is a responsive web app designed to help newcomers in Vancouver (and eventually other cities) quickly find local groups aligned with their interests ‚Äî whether it's a church, a volleyball team, a language exchange circle, or a study group.

When I first moved to Vancouver, I wanted to find a Brazilian church ‚Äî but I had no idea where to look. Like many newcomers, I ended up scrolling through Facebook, asking in WhatsApp groups, and hoping someone would point me in the right direction.

Event sites like Meetup are helpful, but they mostly focus on one-time events and make it hard to find ongoing or regular communities.  
**Find a Community** solves this by offering one simple place to search, join, and stay updated on groups you care about. In the future, an AI feature will suggest communities based on your profile and bio.

## üß≠ Big Picture (High-Level Architecture)

The diagram below illustrates the overall system architecture, including the interaction between the frontend, backend, database, and deployment services.

![High-Level Architecture](./docs/big-picture.png)

Key components:
- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind, runs in the browser, calls backend APIs.
- **Backend**: Node.js (Fastify) handles business logic and API endpoints.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL managed via Prisma ORM, hosted on Supabase.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth flows between frontend and backend.
- **Hosting**: Deployed on AWS (EC2 for backend/frontend, S3 for static assets).
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for build/test/deploy.

## üß© Database Schema

This repository includes the **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram** and database schema for the application.

The schema was designed to support:
- User registration and interest tracking
- Community and event management
- User participation (joining communities and confirming attendance for events)
- Role-based permissions (user, organizer, admin)
- Support for future AI-driven recommendations

### ‚úÖ Tables

- `users`
- `roles`
- `categories`
- `user_interests`
- `communities`
- `events`
- `memberships`
- `event_participants`

> ER diagram generated with [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/d/FSWD-Find-a-Community-6838d1a6bd74709cb72b3376) is available as an image in this repository.

## ‚úçÔ∏è API Contract

This section defines the API endpoints, request/response formats, and authorization needs for the **Find a Community** application.

### General Considerations

*   **Base URL:** `/api` (All endpoints below will be prefixed with this)
*   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Token) sent in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>`.
*   **Request/Response Format:** JSON
*   **HTTP Status Codes:**
    *   `200 OK`: Successful GET, PUT, PATCH request.
    *   `201 Created`: Successful POST request (resource created).
    *   `204 No Content`: Successful DELETE request or successful PUT/PATCH with no body returned.
    *   `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request payload or parameters.
    *   `401 Unauthorized`: Missing or invalid authentication token.
    *   `403 Forbidden`: Authenticated user does not have permission to access the resource.
    *   `404 Not Found`: Resource not found.
    *   `500 Internal Server Error`: Server-side error.
*   **Error Response Format:**
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Short error message",
      "details": "Optional longer description or validation errors"
    }
    ```
*   **Pagination:** For list endpoints, use query parameters `page` (default 1) and `limit` (default 10). Responses will include pagination metadata:
    ```json
    {
      "data": "[...]",
      "pagination": {
        "currentPage": 1,
        "totalPages": 5,
        "totalItems": 48,
        "limit": 10
